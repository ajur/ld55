# LD55 - "Summoning the Genie"
Ludum Dare 55 entry
Theme: **Summoning**

Welcome to my second LudumDate game! :)  
*Please still be forgiving, it's my second entry in **any** game jam :)*

This time I hoped for doing Compo, but I had verry limited time for dev this weekend,
and although I went with verry minimal game concept, I still couldn't make it to the compo.
Well, at least it was enough to went into Jam, so its still progress compared to LD50!

### Changelog:
#### 0.4
- Added music and sounds.
- Somewhat support for portrait mobile (but I probably wont do it properly for all screen sizes).
#### 0.3
- At the end of second day, I had playable mechanics, but lacked sounds and some fixes.
- Decided to drop out of Compo
#### 0.2
- After first day of Jam, rough idea for game was laid out
- Basic graphics and some stuff displayed
#### 0.1
- Initial commit
- Bump Pixi by two versions :O

### Some prod info:
- Code: VSCode, PIXI.js, GSAP, Vite - all smashed together in some makeshift "game engine"
- Art: Drawn by myself, beside background, that was generated with [AI](https://app.leonardo.ai/) and edited slightly.
- Music: Simple track I "composed" by putting together some loops in GarageBand
- Sounds: Scrapped from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/)
- Texts: Items descriptions are generated with ChatGPT.

> Note about usage of AI - I know it's considered **controversial** in some circles,
> and that by some it might look like _cheating_. Sorry, just couldn't resist at least
> some usage, where I knew I couldn't make it with only my skills and time.  
> Also, I couldn't find any info in LD rules about it, and I still tried my best to limit its usage.
